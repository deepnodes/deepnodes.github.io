## 0. Notes

Service Account belong to a namespace.
Service Account specify the access rights, e.g. to any secrets/pods/etc..
To use a serviceAccount, Pod needs to add it to spec (Configure service accounts for Pods):
	spec:
  		serviceAccountName: 

[Configure Service Accounts for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)

A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster).

Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default).

When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the *default service account in the same namespace*. If you get the raw json or yaml for a pod you have created (for example, kubectl get podname -o yaml), you can see the spec.serviceAccountName field has been automatically set.

You can access the API from inside a pod using automatically mounted service account credentials, as described in Accessing the Cluster. The API permissions of the service account depend on the authorization plugin and policy in use.

In version 1.6+, you can opt out of automounting API credentials for a service account by setting **automountServiceAccountToken**: false on the service account.

## 1. How To

**Create SA**

```sh
kubectl create serviceaccount SANAME -n NS --dry-run -o yaml

## k apply -f YAML
```

**Sample**

```sh
######### Create a SA
### ref: "Config Service Account"

k get serviceaccount -n NS
vim sa.yaml
	---
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: ServiceAccount
	metadata:
		name: SANAME
		namespace: NS
	automountServiceAccountToken: false                  # ADD this as required

kubectl apply -f sa.yaml
kubectl get sa -n NS


######### Edit pod yaml，specify the service account
### ref: previous "Config Service Account" has pod sample

k get pod -n NS
vim pod.yaml
	---
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod
	metadata:
		name: PODNAME
		namespace: NS
	spec:
		serviceAccountName: SANAME 
		containers:
		- image: nginx:alpine
			imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
			name: backend

########## Testing/Confirm
kubectl get pod -n NS -o yaml | grep -i serviceaccountname #Find the SA used in the Pod
	# need " -o yaml"  otherwise can't find
kubectl get sa -n NS

########## Clean up
kubectl delete sa *** -n NS
```
